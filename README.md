# French to English and English to French translator
This program translates English to French and vice versa. It includes many common and useful verbs, adjectives, and colors. 
It also generally focuses on topics related to student life (that's what the domain is mostly about).



## Features:
* Dictionary with more than 50 words.
* Fixing the problem of translating "of" for the French words "du" and "de" when it is not necessary,
* Fixing the problem of translating colors before noun when it makes the French translation wrong for example, "vin rouge" is the correct translation for "red wine" and "rouge vin" is wrong,
* When the word from the input is not in the dictionary, the program will not crash and instead it will write the unknown word inside parenthesis (), and I have added lots of comments above the important part of my program.
